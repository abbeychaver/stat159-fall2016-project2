# Conclusions

In this project, we have built five different regression models to predict Balance based on ten predictors from the dataset Credit.csv. Based on our results, we found that ridge regression produced the lowest mean squared error when applied to the test data set. However, we found that the mses were very closely clustered between the five models, and it's difficult to say whether ridge regression is truly optimal for this problem. This result is somewhat surprising: because the data had highly collinear predictors and many uncorrelated predictors, we predicted that a dimension reduction technique would be more useful, or that lasso would outperform ridge regression by eliminating some of the variables from the model. Ultimately, this was not the case.
