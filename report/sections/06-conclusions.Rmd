# Conclusions

In this project, we have built five different regression models to predict Balance based on ten predictors from the dataset Credit.csv. Based on our results, we see that the ordinary least squares regression model yields the lowest mean squared error overall, and the partial least squares regression model yields the lowest mean squared error of the alternative regression models. Therefore we conclude that the ordinary least squares model is the most accurate predictor for Balance based on the ten predictors.
