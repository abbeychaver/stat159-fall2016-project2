The dataset for this project is `data/Credit.csv`.

`code/functions/data_functions.R` contains the functions that generate the summary files and plots for the variables in the Credit.csv dataset. 

The `code/scripts` folder contains R files that actually call the functions from the file above, as well as other files that run different regression models on the `Credit.csv` dataset. 

The `images` folder contains the plots generated by the R files in the code folder. 

The `report` folder contains the individual sections of the report in the `sections` folder, as well as the intermediate file `report.Rmd` and the final `report.pdf`. 

Finally, the `slides` folder contains the slides for the presentation of this project. 

______

To get the code for this project on your own local machine, type `git clone https://github.com/abbeychaver/stat159-fall2016-project2.git` into your terminal. 

Once you have this directory locally, `cd` into the root directory. Then you can run 	`make` commands to compile the code and generate outputs.

- Run 	`make data` to download the Credit.csv dataset to your `data/datasets` folder
- Run `make` or `make all` to run all the R files to generate the text summaries of all the variables, all the plots, and the final report file. 
- Run `make eda` to create summaries and plots for the variables in the Credit.csv dataset
- Run `make ols` to fit the ols regression model
- Run `make ridge` to fit the ridge regression model
- Run `make lasso` to fit the lasso regression model
- Run `make pcr` to fit the pcr regression model
- Run `make plsr` to fit the plsr regression model
- Run `make regressions` to fit all the regression models
- Run `make report` to generate `report/report.pdf`
- Run `make session` to get the info about your current session in session-info.txt
- Run `make clean` to delete `report/report.Rmd` and `report/report.pdf`
